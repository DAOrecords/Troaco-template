This is a front-end template that was forked from SoundSplash, which was forked from FonoRoot.

The `backend` folder was deleted, but the `contract` folder is still there for the automated build process (but we are not working in that directory). The original repository had these 3 folders: `contract`, `backend`, `src`.
Here, only the `src` folder is important. The `global.css` was cleaned up as much as possible, unnecesarry components were removed and unused assets files were removed as well.  

## Install

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm run dev` to try it out
3. Run `npm run build` to create `dist` folder.
